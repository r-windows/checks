Found the following Makefile(s) with an include directive with a pathname using R_HOME:
  src/Makefile.win
Even though not recommended, variable R_HOME may contain spaces.
Makefile directives use space as a separator and there is no portable
way to quote/escape the space in Make rules and directives.  However,
one can and should quote pathnames when passed from Makefile to the
shell, and this can be done specifically when invoking Make recursively.
It is therefore recommended to use the Make '-f' option to include files
in directories specified using R_HOME.  This option can be specified
multiple times to include multiple Makefiles.  Note that 'Makeconf' is
included automatically into top-level makefile of a package.
More information can be found in 'Writing R Extensions'.
